The Military is one of the factions, representing **authoritarianism** and **metal**. Their leader is the **Commander of the Guardians**. They are one of the advisors in the Emanator's throne room.

In game, they are represented by two bars: **military presence** and **suspicion**. 

The Iron Guard is wholeheartedly loyal to the Emanator, unless persuaded otherwise by factors affecting them, such as health and salary. If suspicion is too high, they may turn against the Emanator and join the side of the riot, which will surely succeed.

The Iron Guard believes in strength, stability, and loyalty. They follow the attitude of the Emanator - if the Emanator is kind to their people, they will be kind, etc - and will silence anyone who dares disagree.
