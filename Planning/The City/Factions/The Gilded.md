The Gilded represents **plutocracy** and **air**. Their representative is the Minister of Commerce and Trade, one of the Emanator's advisors. Technically, they are only represented by the Minister, and do not follow him as the Veiled would the Holy Leader.

In game, they are represented by two bars: **favor** and **suspicion**. 

The Gilded is composed of merchants. They control trade in and out of the city - which is vital to its operation. However, although most are rich, they are not respected, and thus aim to seize power (and gain respect) by swaying the Emanator to their side.

The Gilded do not care for the interests of the Commoners, and will happily neglect such interests for personal gain. By trying to seize power, they create a division between the poor and the rich, which may only increase if the Emanator trusts them.
