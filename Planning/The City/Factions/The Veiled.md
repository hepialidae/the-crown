The Veiled is one of the factions, representing **theocracy** and **water**. Their leader known as the **High Priestess**, who is one of the Emanator's advisors.

In game, they are represented by two bars: **favor** and **suspicion**. 

The Veiled came as a result of the Aether's absence. The founders of the Veiled, without someone to follow, were attracted to the **Tidal Tomes**, one of the few remaining texts from the time of humanity's creation.

The Veiled usually build temples dedicated to worshipping Water around springs, which they then declare sacred.

The Veiled worship the spirit of Water. Their beliefs are that:
* Water is the second highest element;
* Water is the source of creation, wisdom, and spiritual purification;
* Using any magic aside from healing magic - which originated from Water - is morally wrong;
* We must adhere to the traditions in the Tidal Tomes:
	* Respecting and revering the oldest female family member;
	* Everyone must wash after awakening, and before the last meal of the day;
	* Every family must keep a vial of Holy Water, from one of the Sacred Springs, in their residence.

Their values include:
* Adhering to tradition;
* Avoiding destruction and maintaining peace;
* Encouraging kindness and community.

They are in conflict with the Arcanum, as they believe that the "new magic" that the Arcanum studies do not align with "peace." In general, the Veiled do not believe development in the arcane will bring about good results.
