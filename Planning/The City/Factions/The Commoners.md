The Commoners represent **communism** and **earth**. Their representative is the Minister of the Commons, one of the Emanator's advisors. 

In game, they are represented by two bars: **favor** and **suspicion**. 

They believe in equality and, well, communist ideals. If pushed far enough, they will try and destroy the division between the poor and the rich, and force everyone to be equal.
