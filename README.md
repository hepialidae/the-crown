# the-crown
**Project Description**

This is my Year 9 passion project. I wanted to make a game to apply my coding knowledge.
This project uses Python (base library) and its Random module. There aren't any graphics yet, but we'll fix that soon. ;)


**Game Description**

The Crown is a city management simulator where you rule as the Emanator of a city under the influence of different factions. Your job is to balance the interests of the factions and perhaps find out more about this strange world...

The Crown operates on a day-by-day system, and your previous actions will have an impact on the city. You dictate the city's future by building architecture, making policies, and using diplomacy to solve problems between factions. Will you be a benevolent ruler, working for the good of your citizens, or will you be the dictator of their nightmares?


**Lore**

The city of The Crown has 5 factions: The Arcanum (scholars), the Commoners, the Gilded (merchants), the Iron Guard (soldiers), and the Veiled (priests). They represent the elemental spirits of fire, earth, air, metal, and water respectively. 

In the beginning of time, the five elemental spirits were in conflict until the Aether came. The Aether unified them and together, created a planet and a first city - the city in which the game takes place. Everything was in harmony until the Aether left for an unexplained reason, and the elemental spirits - now the factions - began to fight again.

On this planet, every human has a bit of each spirit in them, but there will always be one spirit whose influence is the strongest. That human then is considered "aligned" with it and will join the corresponding faction. For example, someone who is under strong fire influence is aligned with the fire spirit and will be a part of the Arcanum.


**Future Development**

Games just aren't as engaging without graphics. I hope to add some UI, voice acting, and pretty pictures to really flesh this game out. I will if I ever make this with a proper game engine.
