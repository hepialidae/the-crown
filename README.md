# the-crown
**Project Description**

This is my Year 9 passion project. I wanted to make a game to apply my coding knowledge.
This project uses Python (base library) and its Tkinter module for some UI elements.

**Game Description**

The Crown is a city management simulator where you rule as the Emanator of a city under the influence of different factions. Your job is to balance the interests of the factions and perhaps find out more about this strange world...

The Crown operates on a day-by-day system, and your previous actions will have an impact on the city. You dictate the city's future by building architecture, making policies, and using diplomacy to solve problems between factions. Will you be a benevolent ruler, working for the good of your citizens, or will you be the dictator of their nightmares?
